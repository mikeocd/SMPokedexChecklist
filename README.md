# Pokemon Sun and Moon Pokedex Checklist

To view the checklist [click here](http://mikeocd.github.io/SMPokedexChecklist/).

The code base for this checklist is taken from [Zachary Kjellberg](https://github.com/ZKjellberg)'s [excellent Dark Souls 3 check sheet](https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet). This, in turn, was created by adopting the source code from [Dark Souls 2 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet/tree/gh-pages) created by [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb). All credit for the way the guide looks and functions should really go to them.

Information for this guide was taken from Serebii, Bulbapedia and the [Pokecommunity Daily](https://daily.pokecommunity.com/2016/11/18/sun-moon-pokemon-alola-dex-locations/)
