# Pokemon Sun and Moon Pokedex Checklist

To view the checklist [click here](http://mikeocd.github.io/SMPokedexChecklist/).

This is a fork of [Zachary Kjellberg](https://github.com/ZKjellberg)'s [excellent Dark Souls 3 cheat sheet](https://github.com/ZKjellberg/dark-souls-3-cheat-sheet). This, in turn, was created by adopting the source code from [Dark Souls 2 Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/smcnabb/dark-souls-2-cheat-sheet/tree/gh-pages) created by [Stephen McNabb](https://github.com/smcnabb). All credit for the way the guide looks and functions should really go to them.

Information for the Pokedex was taken from the games, Serebii, Bulbapedia and the [Pokecommunity Daily.](https://daily.pokecommunity.com/2016/11/18/sun-moon-pokemon-alola-dex-locations/). For Zygarde Cells/Cores, almost everything came from Serebii, [with some help from Eurogamer.](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-12-08-pokemon-sun-and-moon-zygarde-cell-core-locations-list-4925)

Problems? You can follow me on Twitter on [@mikeocd](https://twitter.com/mikeocd); tweeting me is by far the quickest way to reach me.
